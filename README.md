## 🧬 Highlights

### 1. Structured-Coalescent + PSMC Inference (Cambridge Project)
- Full workflow from T2T FASTQ → BAM → VCF → PSMC → structured-coalescent.
- Likelihood heatmaps and ghost introgression signals.
- (See pages 1–2 of the PDF.)

### 2. Deep Learning for Demographic History (Master’s Thesis)
